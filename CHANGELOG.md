## v0.3.0 â€“ 2024-07-17

v0.3.0 is a rewrite from scratch. It _should_ support everything the previous version did, except for the script decompiler, which is replaced with a disassembler/assembler combo.

This release is dedicated to a mysterious sponsor who I hope to reveal one day!

New features:

- Support for Backyard Baseball 1997
- Encoding and decoding images
- Encoding and decoding room audio
- Encoding and decoding talkies
- Disassembling and assembling scripts
